      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADA: These might feel intimidating after your previous experience, but rest assured that you would not be here if you were entirely incompetent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, there tends to be a lot of overlap with those who enjoy playing video games, and those who go on to have careers in software engineering. I think a large part of that comes down to wanting to solve problems, especially problems that have many correct solutions that are never quite ‘perfect’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
